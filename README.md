I developed an movix web based online project. The main aim of the Movix project is any user they can access the system through website at any time without going to the theater and watch movies online. As a new user also he can collect all information like as a movies Available ,list of theaters.
I also deployed my movies website on vercel app .
This is the UI link :-
